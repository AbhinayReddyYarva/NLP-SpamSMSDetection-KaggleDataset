# NLP-SpamSMSDetection-KaggleDataset
Detecting spam SMS with NLP 

Overview (according to folders)
  1. Overview of the dataset and removing punctuations, tokenizing, removing stopwords.
  2. Cleaning data using stemming (or) Lemmatizing
  3. Vectorizing the data - Count vectorizing (or) N-Grams vectorizing (or) Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequecy [TF-IDF]
  4. Feature Engineering - Understanding the existing features and figuring out new features from existing features.
  5. Traning the Machine Learning Model and finding the best model.

With this model development I tried to differenciate the training speed on CPU, GPU (colab), TPU (colab). Go to folder 5-Model Building Evaluating & Selecting and check jupyter notebooks with execution timings.
